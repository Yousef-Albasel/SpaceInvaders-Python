# Space Invaders in Python

This project is an enhanced version of a Python game that aims to strengthen object-oriented programming (OOP) skills. It builds upon a Clearcode Tutorial and introduces new features like animations, explosions, extra hearts, and an additional level for increased complexity.

The future goal of the project is to transform this basic game into a multiplayer experience, allowing players to engage with each other in real-time. Future updates will focus on adding more game features and expanding the multiplayer functionality.
